# Vehicle_Detection_Classification
## Summary 
In this project, I build an advanced vehicle counting, detection and classification system using OpenCV. Use the YOLOv3 algorithm along with OpenCV to detect and classify objects
## Testing 
Download pretrained model: ['yolov3-320.weights'](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d3NFrA1Ym23KYznlAU9GM3trfEEpOm6a/view?usp=sharing). Run vehicle_count.py to test system
